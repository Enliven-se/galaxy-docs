<h3 id="Galaxy Support">Galaxy Support</h3>

You can submit tickets to Galaxy support at [galaxy.meteor.com/support](https://galaxy.meteor.com/support). You can also access the ticketing page from the left-hand dropdown menu within your Galaxy account.

All Galaxy customers can submit support cases from within Galaxy and receive a 1 business day Support SLA.

Galaxy's support hours cover all business days (American holidays excepted) from Monday-Friday, 9AM-6PM Pacific time. Our commitment to you is to respond within the span of one business day from the time of your message's arrival. If you write in outside business hours, your message's arrival time, for SLA purposes, will be counted as the next earliest business hour.

Galaxy support is dedicated to resolving Galaxy-specific issues and troubleshooting cases where Galaxy's performance may be at fault. If you surface a bug in Meteor or Galaxy that prevents deployment, or uncover a problem or performance issue with Galaxy as a whole, Galaxy support will work to resolve this.

While we strive for "best effort" with regard to non-deployment questions pertaining to Meteor, third-party packages and other topics, they are not an officially supported Galaxy subject matter area. Galaxy support does not provide code-level review.

If you would like expert assistance with your Meteor question, consider a subscription to [Meteor Developer Support](#developer).

Galaxy customers have the option to upgrade to higher levels of paid Galaxy support for guaranteed response times as short as 15-minutes with 24x7x365 coverage, including critical cases related to application downtime or degraded performance.

Please contact [Galaxy Sales](mailto:galaxysales@meteor.com) for more details.

<h3 id="meteor-developer-support">Meteor Developer Support</h3>

Meteor Developer Support helps customers build production Meteor apps the right way, ensuring architectural best practices and timely responses to technical inquiries related to Meteor application development.

Please fill out our <a name="developer"/>[Developer Support](https://www.meteor.com/developer-support)</a> form for more information.

<h3 id="Scope">Support Scope</h3>

Because of the wide surface area involved with Galaxy, a number of issues peripherally connected to Galaxy may be classified as out of scope. Questions about an app's performance, stability and implementation are separate from, and different than, supported questions targeting Galaxy's uptime, health, and general deployment capabilities.

Unsupported issues would include a conflict between a third-party npm package and Galaxy that prevents deployment, a database issue on a Galaxy-hosted app, or a question about a logged error that needs to be resolved at the Meteor code level. If you write in to support about an out of scope issue, Galaxy support will explain its status and decline to continue investigating the issue. 

If  an enhanced support experience that does cover these use cases is essential for your app, consider signing up for [Meteor Developer Support](#meteor-developer-support) or [Enhanced Galaxy Support](#enhanced-galaxy-support).

Alternatively, every Galaxy user is welcome to follow up on <a href="http://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/">GitHub</a> or the <a href="https://forums.meteor.com/">forums</a>. GitHub is excellent for tracking issues, while the forums are provided for community use concerning any kind of issue.
