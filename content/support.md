All Galaxy customers can submit support cases from within Galaxy and receive a 1 business day Support SLA.

You can submit tickets to Galaxy support at [galaxy.meteor.com/support](https://galaxy.meteor.com/support). You can also access the ticketing page from the left-hand dropdown menu within your Galaxy account.

Galaxy's support hours cover all business days (American holidays excepted) from Monday-Friday, 9AM-6PM Pacific time. Our commitment to you is to respond within the span of one business day from the time of your message's arrival. If you write in outside business hours, your message's arrival time, for SLA purposes, will be counted as the next earliest business hour.

Galaxy support is dedicated to resolving Galaxy-specific issues and troubleshooting cases where Galaxy's performance may be at fault. While we strive for "best effort" with regard to questions pertaining to Meteor, they are not an officially supported Galaxy subject area. 

If you would like expert assistance with your Meteor question, consider a subscription to [Meteor Developer Support](#developer).
