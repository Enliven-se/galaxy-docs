description: Learn how to check and follow Galaxy's status

Galaxy's status is available from the status page at [status.meteor.com](https://status.meteor.com/). All Galaxy issues are posted to the page, once confirmed.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

You can find out about Galaxy issues as they are identified, investigated and resolved through the status page. While our goal is to have as few incidents as possible, the status page will alert you when service interruptions do occur.

Support collaborates with the Engineering team to make sure the page is updated in a timely fashion, using brief but informative status messages. If you have any questions about an issue as it's developing, contact [support](/support.html) for more information.

<h3 id="subscribe">Subscribe</h3>

Subscribe to our status page to find out about updates in real time. You'll receive an email whenever the status page is updating, meaning you'll find out about issues potentially affecting your app from the moment the team starts recording work on them.

<h3 id="potential-issues">Potential issues</h3>

If you believe you may have uncovered a Galaxy issue, or are currently experiencing one, but do not see it noted on the status page, please contact [support](/support.html) about this. While our SLA is within 1 business day from the time of your message's arrival, support will usually update much more frequently than this in the event of an outage. Please include any contextual information (normal container startup time vs. current container startup time, for example) that will help our team to troubleshoot, in order to move the issue forward to resolution as quickly as possible.
