Ongoing Galaxy Guide development takes place in the open on GitHub. We encourage pull requests and issues to discuss problems with and changes that could be made to improve the clarity and quality of content. Like our open source project Meteor, we hope that keeping our process open and honest will make it clear what we plan to include in the guide and what changes will be coming in future Galaxy versions.
