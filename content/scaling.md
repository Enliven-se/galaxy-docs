Todo:
- Understanding performance + CPU/MEM threshold recommendation
- Scaling
-- horizontally
-- vertically
- Container sizes

When you deploy a new application to Galaxy, the application will be deployed with `compact` containers to start with.

You can then change the container size for the application to any of the following:

- `compact`: 512 MB/0.5 ECU
- `standard`: 1 GB/1 ECU
- `double`: 2 GB/2 ECU
- `quad`: 4 GB/4 ECU
