<h2 id="billing-usage">Pay for what you use</h2>

Billing is based on Galaxy container usage, pro-rated to the second. Billing begins when you deploy and stops when you stop or delete your app. With the current pricing, it will cost you less than $0.17 to run a compact container for 4 hours. Your metered pricing varies with the quantity and size of containers used to run your apps. If you want to stop billing, stop your app, and billing will stop even though the app is still visible in the UI ready to be started again.

Container usage pricing:

- Galaxy (all regions): $0.08 per GB/hour

Customers who signed up prior to August 2016 may have an older Galaxy plan where pricing varies according to the details of their plan, support tier selected, how many containers used, and the size of those containers. 

Pricing is **not** impacted by:

- Memory or CPU usage of your app
- Number of connected clients/traffic
- Number of deploys or users

<h2 id="reserved-pricing">Reserved Pricing</h2>

Galaxy Reserved Pricing guarantees a specific amount of container capacity at a discounted price compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. 

By paying upfront for container capacity, youâ€™ll receive ~20% off the equivalent pay-as-you-go rates. Galaxy Reserved Pricing currently costs $45 USD per GB RAM month (available in 1 GB increments only, billed annually). 

Any usage during the month beyond the reserved base capacity will be billed at normal metered rates. 

<h2 id="billing-update">Payment and statements</h2>

Galaxy accepts PayPal and major credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. You may view and change payment details in your account settings page.

Every month a statement is emailed for the total monthly usage. Statements show metered usage broken out by app. You may view and download past statements in your Galaxy account settings.
