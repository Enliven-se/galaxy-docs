<h2 id="billing-usage">Pay for what you use</h2>

Billing is based on usage down to the second. Billing begins when you deploy or increase the number of containers and stops when you stop your app. With the [current pricing](https://www.meteor.com/why-meteor/pricing), it will cost you less than $0.15 to run a compact container for 4 hours. If you want to stop billing, stop your app, and billing will stop even though the app is still visible in the UI ready to be started again.

Customers who signed up prior to Q2 2016 may have a custom Galaxy plan where the billing rate varies according to the details of their plan, how many containers used, and the size of those containers.

Pricing is **not** impacted by:

- Memory usage of your app
- Number of connected clients/traffic
- Number of deploys or users

<h2 id="reserved-pricing">Reserved Pricing</h2>

Galaxy Reserved Pricing guarantees a specific amount of container capacity at a discounted price compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. 

By paying upfront for container capacity, youâ€™ll receive ~20% off the equivalent pay-as-you-go rates. Galaxy Reserved Pricing costs $40 USD per GB RAM month (available in 1 GB increments only, billed annually). 

Any usage during the month beyond the reserved base capacity will be billed at normal metered rates. 

<h2 id="billing-update">Payment and statements</h2>

Galaxy accepts major credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. View and change payment details by going to your account settings page.

Every month a statement is emailed for the total monthly usage. Statements show usage broken out by app. View and download past statements in the Galaxy app by going to your account settings.
