If you’re on a metered billing plan, you only pay for what you use, down to the second. Billing begins when you deploy or increase the number of containers and stops when you stop your app. Your billing rate is dependent on which Galaxy plan you’ve signed up for, how many containers you’re using, and the size of your containers. With the [current pricing](https://www.meteor.com/why-meteor/pricing), it will cost you less than $0.15 to run a compact container for 4 hours. If you want to stop billing, stop your app, and billing will stop even though the app is still there ready to be started again.

We will send you an invoice over email for the bill when we charge you each month. On the invoice you will see the Galaxy usage charges broken out by app.

Please note that pricing is not impacted by:

- Memory usage of your app
- Number of connected clients/traffic
- Number of deploys or users
